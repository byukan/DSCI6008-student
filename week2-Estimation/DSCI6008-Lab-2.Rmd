# Lab 2: Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For today's lab, we will make use of the EM algorithm to:  

* Estimate parameters in a two-component Normal mixture model
* Make estimations with missing data

Your work should be submitted in a .Rmd file - [a Markdown file created in RStudio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).  

## Two-Component Mixture Model

Continue from the example we looked at in class, and implement the EM algorithm to estimate the parameter $\theta = (w, \mu_1, \sigma_1^2, \mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$. 


```{r}
# Remember to set the current working directory
# To read in the data
mdata = read.csv("2.3-EM/data/mixdata.csv")
head(mdata)
```
```{r}
summary(mdata)

plot(density(mdata$x))
```


## Analyzing Incomplete Data  

Estimate the average income with the incomplete data following the steps we laid out in class. The data is in `2.4-MissingData/data/missingdata.csv`.
