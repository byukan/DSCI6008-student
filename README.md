Description of the Course
---
Advanced Applied Statistics is designed to provide a solid training in advanced, practical statistical data analysis and modeling. The course will cover data analysis in R, experimental design, A/B testing, time series analysis, Bayesian data analysis, stochastic processes, estimation methods and case studies. 

The course will focus on how to apply the statistical methods to real world problems. Students will deliver statistical solutions to a real data science problem every 1-2 weeks.


__By the end of this course, you will be able to__:  

- Carry out advanced data analysis in R
- Design experiments to test causal effects 
- Perform A/B testing

Course Requirements
---

#### Attendance

Students are expected to be present and on time for all class meetings.

#### Class Participation

You will learn more easily and enjoyably if you actively participate. Student contribution to class discussions is highly valued and is critical to the learning process. Students will be asked to participate in class activities designed to encourage open conversation about and involvement in course material.

#### Lab Exercises

Participation in and completion of lab exercises is a requirement for this course. Each unit includes exercises to provide practice applying techniques discussed in class and to reveal deficiencies in understanding in preparation for skills tests.  Some of these will be individual efforts, some will be pairs and group programming.  We will use the aggregate efforts of the class to test a wide variety of different approaches to the problems we will address.  That way the class members will learn from the efforts of their classmates.  It is essential to this process that you stay up to speed on the class so you can be a contributor as well as being a better learner.  


#### Evaluative Exams

There will be three mid-term skills test evaluations to demonstrate comprehension of unit material as well as a final project at the end of the term.

There will be no make-up exams without proper documentation approved by the administration.

#### Late assignments

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date. If you are late to class for any reason, you will miss out on what is covered in the beginning of class, and disrupt classmates when you come in. Take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that you will be ready to turn your assignment in on time (e.g., backup all your work on a memory stick, etc.) 1/2 of the points for the assignment will be deducted each calendar day the assignment is not handed in—regardless of the reason.


#### Academic Integrity

As per the University's Academic Integrity Policy and Procedures:

> The University expects that all students, graduate and undergraduate, will learn in an environment where they work independently in the pursuit of knowledge, conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and respect the intellectual work of others. Each member of the University community has a responsibility to be familiar with the definitions contained in, and adhere to, the Academic Integrity Policy. Students are expected to be honest in their academic work.

Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy include (but are not limited to):

* Cheating -- i.e. Don't read off of your neighbors exams
* Collusion -- Group work is encouraged except on evaluative exams. When working together (on exercises, etc.) acknowledgement of collaboration is required.
* Plagiarism -- Reusing code presented in labs and lectures is expected, but copying someone else's solution to a problem is a form of plagiarism (even if you change the formatting or variable names).

Students who are dishonest in any class assignment or exam will receive an "F" in this course.

### RATs
The readiness assessment tests (RATs) are intended to ensure that students comprehended the material consumed between classes. Students unsure of their comprehension should bring questions to be addressed before the individual RAT. After each student has answered all the questions on the RAT individually, the class will split into teams of 4, who will then review their answers and attempt to reach consensus. Misunderstandings are often better addressed by peers. It is important that all members of each team understand the solution provided by their team. Finally, the answers to the questions will be gone over by the class, hopefully resolving any final misunderstandings before proceeding with the projects.

### Programming Exercises
The RATs are meant to assess the first three levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy#Cognitive), namely knowledge, comprehension, and analysis. The exercises are meant to develop the latter three levels: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.

### Mastery Tracking Makeup
After the presentation session, the remaining class time will devoted to updating the [mastery tracker](https://coursework.galvanize.com/). Students will decide which objectives they want to work on. The Instructor and Data Scientist in Residence will be available to offer feedback and help guide them on their mastery journey.

Grading
---
At GalvanizeU, **Mastery Tracking** is utilized to evaluate real-time student performance across standards and issue final grades at the end the course.

Standards are the core-competencies of GalvanizeU graduates - the knowledge, skills, and habits every student should possess by time they graduate. Standards are measurable, student-focused outcomes that state what students are expected to be able to do by the end of the course. Instructors continually provide formative assessments to monitor student performance and inform their teaching practices. Students who are below ‘mastery’ on a standard are expected to continue practicing said standard (with the instructor’s guidance) until they reach mastery. What matters is that students eventually learn the material, not how many attempts it takes to get there.  

Goals represent areas of expertise that go above and beyond the core requirements of the course.  

Mastery Tracking uses a 4-point scale. Every student is expected to achieve 3 (mastery) across all standards by time they graduate. 1s and 2s indicate areas where students need further practice and/or interventions to reach mastery.

**4 pt Scale:**  

1. <font color=red>Falling far below mastery</font> - Meeting none of the success criteria or has egregious errors
2. <font color=orange>Approaching mastery</font> - Meeting some of the success criteria
3. <font color=lightgreen>Mastery</font> - Meeting all of the success criteria
4. <font color=darkgreen>Exceeding mastery</font> - Truly exceeding expectations and demonstrating proficiency at a higher level of rigor

Every student is expected to achieve at least a 3 on all standards. We will be using Galvanize's Mastery Tracker which can be found at [coursework.galvanize.com](https://coursework.galvanize.com).  

**Final course grades will be determined primarily by achievement of mastery in core competencies for this course (relating to the course goals outlined above).**

| Grade | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| A+    | Performance significantly above A (instructors' discretion) |
| A     | All standards >= 3 and multiple 4s and/or at least 1 significant goal achieved at 3+ |
| A-    | All standards >= 3 and at least one 4 and/or at least 1 minor goal achieved at 2+ |
| B+    | All standards = 3 |
| B     | All standards >= 2 and at least 2/3 of standards > 2 |
| B-    | All standards >= 2 and at least 1/2 of standards > 2 |
| C+    | No more than one standard < 2 and at least 1/3 of standards > 2 |
| C     | No more than two standards < 2 |
| F     | More than two standards < 2 |

### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes and to take examinations as scheduled.  If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by email or phone in advance. Supporting documents (doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness. Instructors have the right to deny any absences. More than 2 excused absences will result in lower grades. Each additional absence will result in lowering your overall course grade by ⅓ of an entire letter grade. It is at the instructor’s discretion to allow students to make-up assignments, exams, etc. resulted from any absences.

You must also show up prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are encouraged to attend all class meetings and participate in class activities. If there are preparation materials (book readings, videos and websites) to cover prior to each class session as stated in the course schedule below, they are always required unless explicitly labeled as optional.

### Electronic Device Policy
Cell phones can be highly disruptive to the class environment. Please silence these devices. In the event of the need to use electronic devices during an person emergency, please step out of the classroom.


### Late Assignments
All assignments are due by the end of the day on the due date. Unexcused late assignments are given a score of zero. No late assignments will be accepted unless the instructor has expressed permission in advance.
